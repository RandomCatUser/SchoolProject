# School Project
An interactive educational web platform designed to enhance learning through dynamic content, including 3D models and informative videos.

## üöÄ Overview
This repository hosts a school project focused on creating an engaging and user-friendly web application for educational purposes. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive resource for understanding various scientific concepts, initially demonstrated through an interactive plant cell model.

## ‚ú® Features
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for seamless viewing and interaction across all devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- **Interactive 3D Model**: Explore a detailed 3D model of a plant cell, providing a dynamic learning experience.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed information about key biological concepts (e.g., plant cell components) with translation support.
- **Educational Videos**: Integrated video section for visual explanations and demonstrations.
- **Project Files Access**: Easy access to download project files from the main and development branches.
- **Team Showcase**: A dedicated section introducing the project contributors.
- **Offline Translation (Sinhala)**: Key educational content includes an offline translation feature for Sinhala.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: For structuring the web content.
- **Tailwind CSS (Offline)**: For rapid and responsive UI development, with all styles embedded for offline access.
- **JavaScript**: For dynamic content loading, navigation, and interactive features.
- **Sketchfab**: For embedding and displaying interactive 3D models.
